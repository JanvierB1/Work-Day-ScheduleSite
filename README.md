# Work-Day-ScheduleSite

## Description

My motivation behind this website was to have a bit more daily organization and help promote it to other people as well. Alot of times I get lost during my day and dont knwo whats next or what times things were supposed to be so this helps a lot with that! This a page anyone can come to and make there day a lot more organzied in a simple way. I learn a lot during this project specially how to work with local storage.
